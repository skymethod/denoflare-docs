## Deploy it to your own account

Since it is a standard module-based Cloudflare Worker, you can deploy it like any other worker with `denoflare push`:

First, register a new app with Unsplash (free), you'll need your app name and _ixid_ as worker environment vars, to comply their TOS.

```
denoflare push --name image-demo \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skymethod/denoflare/v0.7.0/examples/image-demo-worker/worker.ts \
    --text-binding unsplashAppName:your_app_name \
    --text-binding unsplashIxid:your_ixid
```

## Host it locally

Since it is a standard module-based Cloudflare Worker, you can run it locally like any other worker with `denoflare serve`:

First, register a new app with Unsplash (free), you'll need your app name and _ixid_ as worker environment vars, to comply their TOS.
```
denoflare serve \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skymethod/denoflare/v0.7.0/examples/image-demo-worker/worker.ts
    --text-binding unsplashAppName:your_app_name \
    --text-binding unsplashIxid:your_ixid
```
